               Hi, glad to see you here! My name is Esdras Silva I am a front-end developer and I
               study systems analysis and development at the Federal Institute of Science and
               Technology of Para√≠ba
            </p>
            <p>
               I fell in love with the world of programming while doing control and automation
               engineering. I decided to leave the course to seek a central focus of studies, and
               that&apos;s when I found front-end development about a year and a half ago.
            </p>
            <p>
               Since then, I&apos;ve been honing my skills in bringing beautiful and functional
               interfaces to life.
            </p>

};
